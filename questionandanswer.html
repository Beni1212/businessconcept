    <div class="row message-texts">
        
        ANSWER: Payment processors are a kind of internet bank or online financial institution with a high degree of security and protection of personal data whose purpose is to mediate in financial transactions of its users and other online business associates.<br>

        For now, InFace Invest Group has entered into business cooperation with two world-famous payment processors, Perfect Money and Payeer, through which you can perform online transactions completely safely and without any fear - buy a starter pack, pay a deposit, pay your earnings, transfer money to another user or receive money from another user, etc. When registering on payment processors, you enter personal data, after which you need to verify your identity in order to be able to connect your bank account or card with the account on the payment processor. Instructions on registering and opening an account on payment processors can be found in the files of our social network and on the official YouTube channel of the company. In order to register on payment processors, ask your sponsor to send you his referral link through which you will register or use the referral links of our company:<br><br>

        Question: Account verification ?<br><br>

        ANSWER: There are no fictitious orders in InFace Invest Group, and therefore behind each IFIG account of InFace Invest Group there are real people, so it is necessary for users to verify their identity by verifying their IFIG account. InFace Invest Group operates strictly according to the rules of the AML procedure and it is necessary for each user to confirm and prove their identity so that the company has proof to whom it pays money when the user's account starts earning and when the user starts withdrawing money from the system.<br>

        In order to fulfill the obligation to verify their IFIG account, users send a photo of themselves with their personal document via the "My Account - KYC" page.<br><br>

        The personal document with which users can verify their IFIG account are:<br>

        Valid ID card<br>

        Valid passport<br>

        Valid driver's license

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER: 

        SFT21 is a brand of InFace Invest Group that we develop through a franchise form of business.

        The SFT21 business concept is actually a mathematical formula according to which networking and profit distribution takes place on the model of a unique algorithm that enables stable, constant and long-term development.<br><br>

        It is an online franchise business model whose purpose is to create and expand an online business community. A special feature of the SFT21 system is a unique model of member networking and profit distribution with comprehensive online education on Internet business through the educational sector of InFace Universitas.<br><br>

        InFace Invest Group Ltd, ie its founders and owners, designed and created the brand "SFT21" and started creating an online business and social community in which registered members are offered the opportunity to become business associates of our company or SFT franchisors (franchisees) who operate in accordance with the rules of the franchise agreement and as such participate in the distribution of the company's profits also in accordance with the rules of the said agreement.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 
        You need to go to your bank and open an account (it is free in all banks) and request a Visa or Master card.
        If you are blocked, there are various Prepaid cards that are not subject to blockages and you can easily put money on them and add them to the payment processor and make the payment of the starter package.
        There is also the possibility that the existing franchisor (your sponsor / recommender) of the company through your SFT21 business office will send you the money (via the Loan option) required for activation and do so in agreement with hi.<br><br>

        Question: How do I register in the company?<br><br>

        ANSWER : 

        You need to register via referral link from the person who is your referrer. If you do not have a referrer, you can register through the company's website.

        In order for a natural or legal person to become a user of InFace Invest Group, it is necessary to pre-register with SFTUser. 
        <br><br>
        
        When selecting the "Register" option, a natural person or legal entity enters all required data and after registration via the "Login" option can access his IFIG account in order to enter the missing personal data on the "My Account" page.  It is important that the user enters all the data correctly because this is the data that will be written on the user's IFIG SFTUser account, which he will confirm by verifying his account.<br><br>


        The user needs to check the Inbox, Spam, Trash and Junk folders of his e-mail address he entered during registration in order to confirm the registration and be able to access his IFIG account as well as the social network SFToYou.

        Users register as SFT Users and have full access exclusively to the social network SFToYou and if they choose they can activate the starter pack and choose which type of account they want to do business with in the company to take a position in the company's system.

        <h2 class="infaceh2">Question: What are referrals ?</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        Referrals are your members (direct referrals) that you have registered through your referral link as well as members who have registered your direct referrals. Your referral link is located in your business office under the NETWORK option.<br><br>


        What are direct and what are indirect referrals?<br><br>

        Direct referrals are verified users with Starter status that you have registered in the company via your referral link, while indirect referrals are direct referrals of your direct referrals.


        Where are the direct referrals that did not activate the start package, and where are the direct referrals that did activate?
        <br><br>
        
        You can see direct referrals that did not activate the starter pack, and therefore did not take a place in the company system, on the page NETWORK - REFERRALS ON WAITING, while your direct referrals that gained Starter status by activating the starter pack can be seen on the page NETWORK - DIRECT REFERRALS.<br><br>


        How long does it take for an unverified direct referral to turn into a verified one?<br><br>

        The company cannot specify how long it takes for the user to be verified, as this depends on the user.<br><br>


        Why did the person I registered stop being my direct referral?<br><br>

        In order for the person you registered to be your direct referral, it is necessary for the user to verify his IFIG account and activate the start package for it within 30 days from the day of his registration with InFace Invest Group.
        In the event that the user performs verification and / or activation after 30 days from the date of their registration, you lose the sponsorship of the user and the sponsor of that user becomes the company.<br><br>


        How long does it take for a user to take a position in the system from the moment of registration?<br><br>

        The company cannot specify the time in which the user will fulfill his obligations because it depends on the user.
        When the user activates the start package for his account, he takes the first free position in the company's binary matrix, which the company cannot influence.

        ANSWER : 

        A franchise occurs when a company (InFace Invest Group) as a franchisor licenses its trade name (brand) (SFT21) and its way of working (business system) to a certain person or group - franchisees (SFT franchisors) who agree to operate in accordance with terms of the contract (SFT franchise agreement).The franchisor provides support to the franchisee and in some cases has some control over the way the franchisee does business. <br><br>

        In return, the franchisee pays the franchisor an initial fee (franchise entry fee) and a “Royalty Fee” which is a regular or permanent franchise fee for using the trade name and mode of operation.<br><br>


        Prerequisites for signing a franchise agreement:<br><br>

        • Verification of personal or business user account<br>

        • Purchase one of the Starter Packs offered<br>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
       
        ANSWER : 

        InFace Invest Group, as the provider of the SFT21 franchise, has defined the amounts of two franchise fees (entry and regular) that our members, as recipients of the franchise - SFT21 franchisors, are obliged to pay. Each payment of these fees is called - user account upgrade.<br><br>


        Initial franchise fee<br><br>
        
        The entry fee for the SFT21 franchise is 1955 SFTc and can be paid through a minimum of four to a maximum of seven bills or installments (30 SFTc, 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc, 250 SFTc, 500 SFTc, 1000 SFTc).
        It is possible to start a business by purchasing a STARTER package of 205 SFTc which you actually paid for four of the possible seven installments of the franchise, by purchasing a PRO package of 955 SFTc which you paid the first 6 installments of the franchise or by purchasing a MASTER package which immediately paid the full franchise fee.
        After purchasing a STARTER or PRO package (205 SFTc or 955 SFTc), the user can, at his own choice, whenever he wants, upgrade his user account to any level or upgrade his account by paying the full amount of the franchise. 
        Each user can pay for other upgrades by depositing money from the payment processor to their IFIG account, and then transferring it from the Wallet to the Reserve Wallet via the TRANSFER option, or another user can send the money through the system.It is up to the user to decide whether to pay the money for the next upgrades independently or to let the system raise the necessary funds.<br><br>


        UPGRADE TO FULL FRANCHISE AMOUNT - 1955 SFTC<br><br>
        
        The user who decides to upgrade his user account to the full amount of the franchise EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FIRST 30 DAYS from the day of activation of his start package acquires the following benefit:
        - His earnings limit is SFTc 1.000.000 = 1.100.000€.

        <h2 class="infaceh2">Question: How do I verify my business user account (BA)?</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
       

        ANSWER : 

        It is necessary that the document for verification of business user account (BA) without work spaces contains:<br><br>

        • First document: Certificate of legal personality<br>

        • Second document: PIB or registration number of the legal entity<br>

        • Third document: Certificate of incorporation<br>

        • Fourth document: Proof of authorized persons<br>

        • Fifth document: Certificate for an authorized person<br>

        • Sixth document: Document for verification of identification data of the authorized representative<br>

        ID card, passport, driver's license with which you have chosen to verify the account<br><br>


        Since users have already verified their SFTUser account by sending a photography of themselves with their personal document, it is not necessary to submit the same photo in the Business Account Verification (BA) documentation.
        It is necessary that all required documents for verification of a business user account (BA) without work spaces in one PDF document are sent through the system via the page "My Account - Annex".
        Please note that one document issued by the competent institution may contain more information that is necessary to properly fill in your IFIG profile of a business order without work spaces.<br><br>

        What documents are required to verify my business user account (BAWS) with work spaces (WS)?<br><br>


        Users verify their business user account (BAWS) in the same way as a personal user account, ie they send an account verification document through the system that contains a photo of the account holder with a personal document.
        When jobs (ws positions) reach the earnings determined by the previously defined and paid limit, the business account holder (BAWS) submits complete company documentation and evidence of registered workers (whose income must be reported at € 2,500).

    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        It depends on the country in which you live, ie the legal way in which internet business is regulated.<br><br>


        What if the state blocks the money I earned from InFace Invest Group Ltd that I transferred from the payment processor to my bank account?<br><br>

        The money you earn in InFace Invest Group Ltd is legally earned money in accordance with all international rules and there are valid invoices for each transaction and for each earnings that you can find in your Internet office. Therefore, there is no justifiable reason for someone to block those funds.

        Should such a thing happen, as proof of your legal business on your IFIG account you can find every transaction of your earnings in the form of invoices that you can always (24/7/365) find and, if necessary, print and deliver to anyone as proof of your business and origin of earned earnings. In addition to the invoices from your IFIG account, as proof you also have the invoices of your user account from the payment processor through which you made payments or withdrawals.

        Each transaction is recorded both in your InFace Invest Group user account and in your payment processor user account, so you can always confirm the origin of the earnings and the course of each transaction.

        The business of InFace Invest Group Ltd is in accordance with all international rules and legal regulations, which can always be seen on the official website of the company's portal. The same pages contain contact information that can be contacted by any service or department (in any country) to which we are always ready and willing to submit documentation on legal business.

InFace Invest Group has nothing against that.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 


        On the WALLET page, there is a WITHDRAWAL function which is used to pay your earnings, which you transfer from the Wallet to your account of the payment processor, from which you then pay the earnings to your bank account or card.<br><br>


        Is there a minimum or maximum earnings limit that I can withdraw ?<br><br>

        Payment is always possible (24/7/365) when you have funds available in your Wallet. The minimum or maximum payout limit does not depend on InFace Invest Group Ltd, but is determined by the payment processors. One of our main goals in the near future is to create our own payment processor with which we will regulate the stated limits to the satisfaction of our members.
        <br><br>

        What payment processors can I withdraw money to?<br><br>

        At the moment, this is possible on Perfect Money and Payeer, while we will inform you about the connection of other payment processors in a timely manner.<br><br>


        What are the costs of an earnings payment transaction?<br><br>

        The amount of transaction costs is determined by the payment processors and it depends on the amount you intend to transfer, which will always be shown to you at the request for payment.<br><br>


        How soon do I receive a payment to the payment processor?<br><br>

        InFace Invest Group approves the payment request within 24 - 48 hours up to a maximum of five working days. The reason why the approval of the payment may take time is because in the first 24 hours it is checked whether you really submitted the request or someone misused your user account. 

        Within that period, we send a notification of the submitted request for payment to your e-mail address with which you are registered in the system, and if you agree, in the next 24 hours the money will be transferred to your payment processor. The company reserves the right in case of suspicious transactions to postpone it until the inspection, ie up to 5 working days.
        <br><br>

        How long does it take to transfer from the payment processor to my bank account or card?<br><br>

        This varies from processor to processor, and in practice it is 3-5 working days.<br><br>


        Can the payment of money be made directly from the IFIG account to the user's bank account?<br><br>

        InFace Invest Group pays money exclusively to Perfect Money and Payeer payment processors.

        Payment of money to the user's bank account is not possible.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        There are no fictitious orders in InFace Invest Group, and therefore behind each IFIG account of InFace Invest Group there are real people, so it is necessary for users to verify their identity by verifying their IFIG account. InFace Invest Group operates strictly according to the rules of the AML procedure and it is necessary for each user to confirm and prove their identity so that the company has proof to whom it pays money when the user's account starts earning and when the user starts withdrawing money from the system.<br><br>

        In order to fulfill the obligation to verify their IFIG account, users send a photo of themselves with their personal document via the "My Account - KYC" page.<br><br>

        In order to fulfill the obligation to verify their IFIG account, users through the "My Account" page send a photo of themselves with their identification document.<br><br>

        The personal document with which users can verify their IFIG account are:<br>

        - Valid ID card<br>

        - Valid passport<br>

        - Valid driver's license<br><br>


        How is user data protection done? <br><br>

        Data protection is done by uploading to the server, the data is first encrypted by the AES method in combination with RSA-4096, which is adopted by all US government agencies such as the NSA, CIA, and then pseudonymized.<br><br>

        After the user identification is checked, that data is deleted from the vault and every trace of that upload and data as well, because that data has fulfilled its purpose, that is. identification of the person just as GDPR, US Policy, ZZLP, etc. order.<br><br>

        The only image that stands out and is not deleted during the verification is the image of you where you keep the document and which serves as proof that we are not engaged in money laundering, which is known in the world as AML verification. Of course, if you decide to deactivate your account a picture of you holding an identity document is also deleted from the system.<br><br>

        With this encrypt, pseudonym method as well as deleting data that are no longer needed and that have fulfilled their purpose, we also meet GDPR regulations as well as others such as the US Privacy Model, Serbian ZZLP, etc.<br><br>

        As for the staff who check the same documents, they are on a special LAN connection and do not have any port open for communication except with each other through a server that is protected by the latest generation of firewalls (hardware cisco), they can not download or do anything with that documents. Upon entering the workplace, Support Team workers put their phones away before entering the room and go through a scanner that detects any electrical devices or metals and non-metals, also the office is under full video surveillance, and cameras are places above each workplace.

        EARNING METHOD : Referral Bonus or BC Sponsorship Bonus (BONUS RECOMENDATIO)
        The referral bonus is the earnings that YOU receive ONLY from the users that you have registered as your direct referrals. When your direct referrals receive their friendly bonus earnings (BAB), you as their sponsor will receive a REFERRAL BONUS which depends on the number of direct referrals that have verified and activated your account.<br><br>

        Explanation:<br>
        BC bonus depending on career status: BC 10%, BC 20%, BC 30%, BC 35%, BC 40%, BC 45%, BC 50%.<br>
        By increasing the number of direct members, i.e. franchisors, your BC bonus also increases:<br>
        1      Direct Referral   = BC 10% <br>        
        2      Direct Referral   = BC 20% <br>    
        3 -6   Direct Referrals  = BC 30% <br>
        7- 9   Direct Referrals  = BC 35% <br>
        10 -13 Direct Referrals  = BC 40% <br>
        14 -20 Direct Referrals  = BC 45% <br>
        21     Direct Referral   = BC 50% <br><br>


        EXAMPLE: If you have a BC bonus of 50%, and if your direct referral has earned, for example, 1000 SFTc (€ 1100) per BAB bonus, it means that you have instantly earned 500 SFTc (€ 550). Now imagine that you only have 10 direct referrals that earn e.g., € 1100. And imagine that only one direct earns you the full amount per BAB bonus (81.840,00 SFTc). So, the more direct the bigger and the faster your earnings.

    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        In addition to the personal account (PA), you can IMMEDIATELY if you want to register a BA or BAWS account (business account / business account work space) as a legal entity.<br><br>


        Also, if you have reached the PLATINUM career status on one of your PA accounts, ie, if you have 14 direct franchisors, then you have the right to open another PA account in your name.<br><br>


        To open a third account, you need to have 14 franchisors on the first and second. 

        Eg: In order to have 6 accounts, you need to have 14 franchisors on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th account.<br><br>

        ANSWER : 

        Your referrer will give you a referral link through which you can register and perform verification through your business office, ie. KYC authentication (because there can be no fictitious / fake accounts on SFToYou).<br><br>


        If you do not have a referral link you can register directly via the main page by going to the Sign In option in the upper right corner. <br><br>


        After successful authentication, you have access to the SFToYou social network. You log in through your SFT21 business office or directly through the main SFToYou site.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        The biggest difference is that all active members of the company can earn from the activities on our SFToYou social network. Unlike other networks where the profit made by the social network is shared only among the ownership structure, in SFToYou profit is shared with its members.<br><br>

        Also, a huge difference in relation to ALL other social networks is that WE DO NOT HAVE FAKE ACCOUNTS, ie FICTITIOUS PERSONS. Each member of the SFToYou social network is a person who has verified their account, passed the authentication (KYC) and thus presented on the social network under his full real name and surname.<br><br>

        This means a lot for the users because there is no need to censor freedom of speech on our part (because everyone is personally responsible for what is said), but also for advertisers who know that for their money they get the right people who are interested in their products, services or surveys.

        ANSWER : 

        You can advertise the products and services on SFT Shop through any advertising channels as you would with any other product (Facebook, Google advertising, direct advertising, through your personal blogs on SFToYou or other social networks, through your personal websites, etc.).
        InFace Invest Group also has basic and advanced training that certified leaders will make available to you.

        Question: Do I have to sell all the products?

        ANSWER : 
        You don't have to. You can download only the products that you want to advertise and sell from your personal Shop from InFace warehouse.<br><br>

        
        Question: How do I add products and how do they come to my Shop?<br><br>

        ANSWER :
        You will have an option in the admin part whether you automatically want to fill your shop with products or manual filling, which the company does not recommend, but provides as an option.
        Anyone who chooses the option of manual filling of products in the first place does a bigger job for themselves, and in the second place deprives themselves of earning money from products that will not be in his shop, and thus deprives customers of the opportunity to choose.
        Never let anyone deprive you of anything in your business and always provide a choice as the company provides to you automatically and manually and advises you to choose the option automatically and thus provide future customers with insight into all products sold through the company shop.

        METHOD OF EARNINGS: DB or direct bonus is earned from each upgrade of your direct member in the amount of 10% of the monthly franchise fee.
        <br><br>

        
        EXPLANATION :<br><br>

        Each of your direct members will pay a monthly franchise fee from the payment of the starter pack onwards indefinitely in the following order:<br>

        From any payment of the starting package 205, 955 or 1955, the monthly fee and distribution starts from 30 SFTc and over 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc, 250 SFTc, 500 SFTc and 1000 SFTc, so each subsequent fee is in the amount of 1000 SFTc.<br>

        From each listed fee you will earn a DB bonus of 10% which would be:<br>

        3 SFTc, 2.5 SFTc, 5 SFTc, 10 SFTc, 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc and each subsequent one is in the amount of 100 SFTc.<br>

        From each direct member only until his full franchise payment you will earn 195.5 SFTC. For example, if you registered about 10 members in a short period of time, in this example you would earn the full amount of the deductible in that period, and after that period your monthly salary only for this bonus would be 1000 SFTc.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        The payment processor is not a bank that many do not understand and do not understand, and the word processor itself says that it is a process which in free interpretation means that the processor is software as an intermediary between the user bank and the company, and vice versa between the company and the user bank. The processor provides security because it is neutral and it is only an intermediary in the business and as such protects the company from users and users from the company. Every house or company that is directly engaged in the card business already casts doubt on itself that fraud is behind it. Behind every processor must stand a serious and strong bank as a guarantor and security of business processors. If a direct bank-bank business would be used, it does not matter whether it is a user-user or a company-company or a user-company, a company-user, abuse can occur because there is no mediator or intermediary in such business while the processor plays that role.<br><br>

        Question: How can I use a payment processor? 
        <br><br>
        
        ANSWER : 
        Our processor will be customized for the business of individuals and legal entities and will provide security in financial transactions as well as in withdrawing money or sending money to another user as a natural or legal person. In addition to financial flows and transactions, our processor will enable each company or legal entity to manage its business in one place, so there will be options for entering relevant information so that the software can process data automatically and provide the ability to download balance sheets and all bookkeeping operations. in principle, all in one place, without the need for bookkeeping or accountant.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER : 

        Anyone who thinks that he doesn't need a processor is grossly mistaken, and the most important reason is that it is very difficult, and in our case simply impossible, to make malversations on a payment processor. The security of the money in the account is the most important, so the money that will be on our payment processor will be provided so that you can never lose it. For example: If someone hacks you and accesses your processor, they will not be able to do anything because we have provided protection that we cannot talk about until the end of the processor because it is a business secret. If someone hacks your bank account they can withdraw money from you, if someone steals your card they can spend your money, if someone pockets you and takes cash and in that case you run out of money, but if our payment processor hacks you all of the above will remain yours because it will be absolutely protected.<br><br>

        
        Question: Can I keep my money on the processor? 
        <br><br>
        
    
        ANSWER : 
        Absolutely yes and it is also recommended because it is the safest place where you can save your money. Every action that takes place on the payment processor requires a certain process, and in that process there is a "handle" because in addition to each of your actions there will be one or two additional steps to make sure that we as a company did it and not someone on your behalf, and that’s the key reason why you should just keep the money on the payment processor. That model that we will offer in the payment processor currently does not have any payment processor that is currently administered on the Internet. Knowing all the models and modes of operation of payment processors (20 years have been invested in the development of our processor to improve all the shortcomings and shortcomings of both the banking sector and payment processors) and if anything can be stated as perfect, the closest to that definition will be our payment processor.

        Yes indeed. Your Money on the payment processor is in the company bank, and you don’t even have to use that same bank and you can have your own other bank.

Eg: Sending money by Western Union depending on the country to the country is 5-10%, and transferring money or sending to another user on our processor will range between 1 and 2%, while payments will not be burdened with costs.<br><br>

        
        Question: "What currency can I use on my processor?"
        <br><br>
        
    
        ANSWER : 
        Absolutely all crypto as well as convertible currencies will be able to be used, but in addition to all convertible currencies, non-convertible currencies will also be able to be used, because InFace Invest Group will soon register its business in all countries that exist on the planet. At the moment, we will do business with currencies from those countries, so it does not matter to us whether it is convertible or non-convertible, as well as which cryptocurrency is in question, the only thing that cryptocurrencies need to be on ICO and recognized in the world.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        ANSWER: 
        Deadlines are determined according to a business plan drawn up by the project proponent, adjusted by the Board of Directors and increased over a reasonable period of time.Eg: The project developer asks for two million euros in his business plan for investment, and according to the business plan he can return the investment in two years, the company will give him a period of two years and 6 months. Of course, if the development of the project does not go exactly according to plan, but is less developed, the company will, according to the insight and assessment, extend the deadline for return on investment. The company is not interested in taking away a project from someone or abusing its investment in any way, but has only one goal, and that is for the project to come to life so that the company can get a return on its investment and be able to participate in the next project, and the project proponent to become independent and to continue further business without the company.
        <br><br>

        
        Question: Who are the people on the Board of Directors?
        <br><br>
        
    
        ANSWER: 
        The Board of Directors is exclusively Certified Leaders, but in addition to the certificate, they must also have some experience, ie. knowledge of the area or industry in which the investment is made, and the assessment of their expertise is performed by the company.
        The board is made up of 10 Certified Leaders and each CL earns 2% of the net income generated by a particular project up to the time of the return on investment.

        <h2 class="infaceh2">LIMITS ON BUILDING YOUR CARRIER STATUS</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
       
        EXPLANATION: <br>

        If you have decided not to register any direct referral within 80 days from the day of your registration and activation, your unique referral link will be permanently blocked and will not have the right to continue building your career and you remain at the limit of 102.3 SFTc.<br><br>

        If you register a new direct referral within 90 days from the day of registration of the last direct referral, which will perform identity verification and activation, ie purchase one of the starter packs, you get a new 90 days to continue building your career and achieve higher career status. (For example, you enrolled your second referral on a specific date, and from that date you have another 90 days to register a new one if you want to continue building your career.)<br><br>

        When you achieve SMARAGD career level, from that point on there are no more time limits for you and you are free to continue building your career status at any time until the last and biggest, and that is SFT DIAMOND.<br><br>

        According to this principle, each member, if he wishes, could achieve career status of SMARAGD in the longest possible period of 63 months. (For example, in the first 3 months you registered 1 member, and in the other 60 months you registered another 20, ie one in every 3 months.)
