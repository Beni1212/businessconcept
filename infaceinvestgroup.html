        This presentation is valid from 01.10.2021 and all changes described in this presentation will be made no later than 30.10.2021 and those changes will take effect from the moment of release into the system.<br><br>

        Anyone who registers at a given time, and a new change has not already been released, it will not be a subject to that change.All new changes will be released into the system as soon as they are completed, and this can happen from day to day, so it is very important that, before registering a member, you enter the system and check if they are in force, and any change will be announced through official notifications.<br><br>

        By visiting your ‘Back Office’, check in the notification if something has changed in the meantime, and in case something has changed, you need to inform the new member about that change, and only then help him to register if he agrees. <br><br>

        We note this because in the meantime, the start packages may change, for example, you start registering a user, and you have not checked that the changes have occurred, and then you encounter a new package value. Changes will be made late at night and the announcement will be waiting for you when the new day starts, so in this way we try to avoid inconveniences for the company, and you as a sponsor when registering a new member.

        If you've failed in your businesses in the past, it's not your fault!
        <br><br>
        
        If you've been worried in the past that you can't succeed in a business whether online or offline, you can stop worrying.
        <br><br>
        
        Other big corporations want you to think you can't make real money online and get financial freedom or get a bigger return on investment without them, but that's not true!
        <br><br>
        
        If you ever thought there was some “SECRET" that big corporations and companies don't want you to know, you're probably right.
        <br><br>
        
        That is why we have decided to create this presentation/webinar to show you how to build and improve your business with the help of only one software, without much knowledge in the field of business management.

        SFToYou - A social network that is unique for its many functionalities and stands out for its ability to make money. Initially in three ways, and later much more, from passive work through (Pay Per Click, Advertising and Survey that are in Preparation phase), creating personal Blogs and connecting personal domains to those blogs (separated from SFToYou), with huge marketing opportunities. Other ways are currently a secret until completing the SFToYou social network.<br><br>
        
        A unique social network or as we like to point out: "Community of successful and satisfied people", in which each member verified their identity and there are no fictitious or false accounts.<br><br>
        
        The reason for everything mentioned above is that there is no censorship on SFToYou and everyone bears responsibility for their actions. Each member can exercise their rights before the competent courts if they feel threatened or offended in any way by an individual or an organization, and the company is ready to submit the data of an individual or organization to the competent institution at any time, which in this case is the court, to provide the data of an individual or organization in order for an endangered or offended member to exercise their rights.<br><br>

        Each professor will use the software for the entire education of students, pupils or students for their subject with all the necessary materials in video and text format with the easy possibility of making online tests at their discretion without prior knowledge of IT with minimal training in the form of video instructions for proper setting or making of tests.
        <br><br>
        
        The entire software management training will be tailored in video instructions according to the levels from the Ministry to the professor or lecturer, and help will be available with the support of our support team.
        <br><br> 

        Our software will be available as an application that each educational institution will download from the pages of SFT universitas on the portal after registration and payment of a monthly fee from which members who are recommended as sponsors will receive a certain percentage as long as that institution uses and pays a monthly fee for using the software. There are simply no more trips to lectures and exams, as well as tireless lectures from year to year and repetition of the same thing until the professor retires. Our software provides the opportunity to develop, educate and engage in the scientific work of professors for the purpose of training.

        This order is a prerequisite that refers to the classic registration with mandatory identity verification and does not only apply to the purchase of positions. With free registration and verification, the user has access to SFToYou as a user of the social network without the possibility of earning money, creating blogs, organizing events.
        <br><br>

        This is one way for people to know and understand our system. By making the decision to activate at any time, only sponsors have the opportunity to animate such users in the first 30 days in order to keep these users as their direct members by activating their account. Otherwise, if the activation occurs after the 30th day of this account, the sponsor is the Admin, ie. Company.
        <br><br>

        The reason is simple, and it relates to the sponsors:
        It is not enough to share the link and there is an end, you have to do your best and keep the focus on the direct member as a Sponsor.<br><br>

        By registering and verifying your personal identity, you get SFTuser status, and by activating with the starting package 205 SFTc, 955 SFTc or 1,955 SFTc you become an active member and you are given the opportunity to make a profit, and you will be able to sign a franchise agreement. Optionally you can continue to build your career status by registering referrals.

        Important note: Any user who has not met the specified conditions with the 90-day conclusion, the system automatically ejects him from his position, and that position becomes system account. The member can be re-registered with the company at any time under the same conditions.

        I reason :  Members quiting for any reason<br><br>
        
        II reason : Expulsion of a member for non-compliance with company rules or negative connotations without argument and all of the above in the terms of use as well as the rules required by the company.<br><br>

        The sponsor needs to make an effort and direct his member to what and how he needs to do to ensure his stay in the company.  If a user leaves the system or is expelled, they do not receive a refund.<br><br>
        
        SA position continues to operate, and the sponsor has the opportunity to register another member in that position with the payment of the same package with which the position was created within 30 days from the date of SA creation. If the sponsor does not register a new member within the specified time frame, the position becomes company and is sponsored by Admin, and it is named IFIGXXXXXXXX (IFIG + position number).

        The Company retains this position in its ownership until the position receives a value of 10.080 SFTc. And how does it gain value:<br><br>

        Each member under the BAB bonus increases the value of this position by 480 SFTc. Each member under the BAB bonus from his seventh upgrade onwards to this position will bring 40 SFTc, and that amount is multiplied by 12 months which is 480 SFTc. When it reaches the specified value or 21 members per BAB bonus, this position ends on the company stock exchange position.<br><br>
        
        The Company provides an opportunity for all existing members to sell this position and get sponsorship over it, and make earnings of 10% while in addition to all of the above certified leaders receive 20% of the value of IFIGXXXXXX position.<br><br><br>

        In the event that a company sells this position, the company takes 100% of the value and retains the sponsorship and the company will award at its discretion to deserving members as a incentive or reward for work and effort.

        Full Franchise Compensation is up to 7 instalments; 30 SFTc, 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc, 250 SFTc, 500 SFTc and 1.000 SFTc.<br><br>

        Each member upgrade per BAB brings you 4% which is:<br><br>
    
        30 SFTc   - 96% =    1.20 SFTc X 2046   =    2.455,20 SFTc<br><br>

        100 SFTc  - 96% =    4.00 SFTc X 2046   =    8.184,00 SFTc<br><br>
  
        250 SFTc  - 96% =    10 SFTc X 2046     =    20.460,00 SFTc<br><br>
  
        500 SFTc  - 96% =    20.00 SFTc X 2046  =    40.920,00 SFTc<br><br>

        EARNING METHOD: Bonus COMMENDATIO, or BC Referral Bonus. 
        BC bonus are earnings that you receive only from users that you have registered as your direct referrals. When your direct referral receive their earnings on a friendly bonus, you, as their sponsor, will receive BONUS recommendations that depend on the number of direct referrals that have verified and activated their account.<br><br>

        Explanation :<br><br>

        BC height depending on career status: BC 10%, BC 20%, BC 30%, BC 35%, BC 40%, BC 45%, BC 50%.<br><br>

        By growing the number of direct members, i.e. Franchiser, your BC bonus also grows:<br><br>
      
        1                Direct Referral        =         BC 10%<br><br>
        2                Direct Referral        =         BC 20%<br><br>
        3-6              Direct Referral        =         BC 30%<br><br>
        7-9              Direct Referral        =         BC 35% <br><br>
        10-13            Direct Referral        =         BC 40% <br><br>
        14-20            Direct Referral        =         BC 45% <br><br>
        21               Direct Referral        =         BC 50% <br><br>


        EXAMPLE: If you have a BC bonus of 50%, and if your direct referral has earned, for example, 1000 SFTc (€ 1100) per BAB bonus, it means that you have instantly earned 500 SFTc (€ 550). Now imagine that you only have 10 direct referrals that earn e.g., € 1100. And imagine that only one direct earns you the full amount per BAB bonus (81.840,00 SFTc). So, the more direct the bigger and the faster your earnings.

        METHOD OF EARNINGS: DB or direct bonus is achieved from each upgrade of your direct member in the amount of 10% of the monthly franchise fee.<br><br>
        
        EXPLANATION : <br><br> 

        Each of your direct members will pay a monthly franchise fee from the payment of the starter pack onwards indefinitely in the following order:<br><br>

        From any payment of the starting package 205, 955 or 1955, the monthly fee and distribution starts from 30 SFTc and over 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc, 250 SFTc, 500 SFTc and 1000 SFTc, so each subsequent fee is in the amount of 1000 SFTc.<br><br>

        From each listed fee you will earn a DB bonus of 10% which would be:

        3 SFTc, 2.5 SFTc, 5 SFTc, 10 SFTc, 25 SFTc, 50 SFTc, 100 SFTc and each subsequent one is in the amount of 100 SFTc.<br><br>

        From each direct member only until his full franchise payment you will earn 195.5 SFTC. For example, if you registered about 10 members in a short period of time, in the given example you would earn the amount of the full franchise in that period, and after that period your monthly salary only for this bonus would be 1000 SFTc.

    </div>
    <div class="row message-texts">
        
        
        EXPLANATION : 

        If you have not decided to register any direct referral within 90 days from the day of your registration and activation, your unique referral link is permanently blocked and you do not have the right to continue building your career and you remain at the limit of 102.3 SFTc.<br><br> 

        If you register a new direct referral within 90 days from the day of registration of the last direct referral, which will perform identity verification and activation, ie purchase one of the starter packs, you get a new 90 days to continue building your career and achieve higher career status. (For example, you enrolled your second referral on a specific date, and from that date you have another 90 days to register a new one if you want to continue building your career.)<br><br> 

        When you come to SMARAGD career status then there are no more time limits for you and you are free to continue building your career status at any time until the last and biggest, and that is SFT21 DIAMOND.<br><br> 

        According to this principle, each member, if he wishes, could be built up to the career status of SMARAGD in the longest possible period, which is 63 months. (For example, in the first 3 months you registered 1 member, and in the other 60 months you registered another 20, ie one every 3 months.)

        I want to show you where people like you were before they started working with InFace Invest Group franchise software.<br><br>
        
        Most of them were struggling  in other businesses and got stuck in all these technical things.<br><br>
        
        They couldn't make real money online and get financial stability. Things were difficult because they’d never had a software set like this before in one place. It's important to keep your focus and not let anyone distract you from your business. This is the only way to get real success.<br><br>
